## üìù Introduction

Merge Sort is one of the most efficient sorting algorithms, following the **divide and conquer** approach. This project implements the Merge Sort algorithm using a **Linked List** in C++, focusing on dynamic memory management, which adds flexibility and demonstrates real-world applications.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- **Efficient Performance**: Runs in O(n log n) time, optimal for large datasets.
- **Linked List Based**: Implements the sorting algorithm using linked lists instead of arrays.
- **Structured Code**: Modular design with separate functions like `findMiddle`, `merge`, and `sortList`.
- **Dynamic Memory Handling**: Demonstrates effective usage of dynamic memory allocation and deallocation in C++.
- **Documentation**: Includes comments and explanations to make the code easy to understand and modify.

## üí° How Merge Sort Works

Merge Sort recursively breaks down the list into smaller parts, sorts them, and then merges them back together. The process is straightforward and follows these steps:

1. **Divide**: Split the list into two halves.
2. **Conquer**: Recursively sort both halves.
3. **Combine**: Merge the two sorted halves back into one.

### **Step-by-step Visualization:**

```text
Original List:  [38, 27, 43, 3, 9, 82, 10]
Split into:     [38, 27, 43, 3]  [9, 82, 10]
Split further:  [38, 27] [43, 3] [9] [82, 10]
Sorted halves:  [27, 38] [3, 43] [9] [10, 82]
Merged List:    [3, 27, 38, 43, 9, 10, 82]
Final Sorted:   [3, 9, 10, 27, 38, 43, 82]

```
## üíª Code Overview

This implementation consists of the following key functions:

- `findMiddle(Node* head)`: Finds the middle node of the linked list to split it into two halves.
- `merge(Node* left, Node* right)`: Merges two sorted linked lists into one.
- `sortList(Node* head)`: The recursive function that sorts the linked list using Merge Sort.

### Key Components:
```cpp
Node* findMiddle(Node* head);
Node* merge(Node* left, Node* right);
Node* sortList(Node* head);
```
